Dummy Public App for Shopify built with Node Includes Embedded App SDK [Elkfox](https://www.elkfox.com).

### Requirements

  - node.js >= 6.11.0
  - mongodb >= 3.2.9
  - npm >= 5.0.0

### Introduction

We have tried to write this documentation in a tutorial format so that it can be understood by everyone of all skill levels. If you just want the basics check out the [readme.md](https://github.com/Elkfox/Shopify-Node-App)

That being said a prior knowledge of the terminal and javascript will be required. If you have any questions at all don't hesitate to raise an issue on Github.

This tutorial makes the assumption that you are using a unix based operating system (Mac/Linux).
